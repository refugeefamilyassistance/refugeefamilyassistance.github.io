              <h3>Who are the Rohingya?</h3>
              <p>The Rohingya are a stateless ethnic minority group from the Rakhine State in Myanmar (Burma). They are often referred to as one of the world’s most persecuted minorities. Over 1,000 Rohingya people have resettled in the Dallas-Forth Worth metroplex as refugees. They are friends, neighbors, students, business owners, and many of them fellow citizens of the United States.</p>
              <br>
              <h3>What is a refugee?</h3>
              <p>A refugee is someone who has been forced to flee conflict or persecution and cannot return to their country without risking their life or freedoms. It is a legal term that carries with it certain protections that refugees are entitled to. A refugee is different from an asylum seeker, a migrant worker, or an undocumented immigrant.</p>
              <br>
              <h3>How do refugees get here?</h3>
              <p>Refugees undergo a series of 8 background checks and security clearances over the course of several months to several years. They are the most vetted immigrants to come to the United States. Refugees are given full legal status upon arrival and are legally allowed to work in the U.S. They pay taxes and they also pay back all funds lent to them for resettlement to the U.S.</p> 
              <br>
            <h3>What happened after the inauguration?</h3>
            <p>Recent executive orders have deeply impacted the lives of refugees and the services available to them. On January 20th, 2025, an executive order was signed halting all refugee resettlement into America – including those already fully vetted and some awaiting to reunite with family after many years. This has left many families in limbo in harsh circumstances.</p>
            <p>Another executive order was made stopping most foreign aid - including federally funded assistance promised to refugees. This means assistance given through caseworkers, such as rent, social security cards applications, food stamps, medical care, job applications, school registration, and more, has come almost completely to a stand still. Many families are in immediate danger of homelessness without intervention.</p>

  <div class="get-involved">
    <h2>Ways to Get Involved</h2>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="left-column"><h3>Benevolence Fund</h3><p>Until recently, people settled in the U.S. as refugees were given cash assistance for their first several months while they acquired necessary documents for employment and sought jobs to provide for their families. Now, many recently arrived families are at risk of losing their homes and have no food to put on the table. This fund, through CrossPoint Church of Christ, will go towards rent, utilities, and enabeling families to purchase necessities.</p></div>
        <div class="right-column"><a href="https://pushpay.com/g/crosspointcofc?fnd=E9beSrLtDo6JCbwdezEgEg&fndv=Lock&r=No&lang=en&src=pcgl" class="button">Give Here</a></div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="left-column"><h3>Household Items</h3><p>Recently arrived families used to be provided with basic household items upon arrival by local resettlement agencies. Without these agencies, many are in need of kitchen, cleaning, and other household items. These items are listed for purchase on an Amazon wishlist hosted by our partner, Vickery Trading Co. </p></div>
        <div class="right-column"><a href="#" class="button">Purchase Items</a></div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="left-column"><h3>Donating Furniture</h3><p>Just as families are lacking basic household items, they are needing beds, dressers, couches, and more. To see what items are needed or to donate, fill out this form.</p></div>
        <div class="right-column"><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd8SkkNZ6m-u6cKrIdBfXDxTJmIPBPCQvitUI-TXyRvfheY2Q/viewform?usp=sharing" class="button">Donate Furniture</a></div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="left-column"><h3>Give Your Time</h3><p>Due to the recent government orders, many caseworkers have been furloughed and are unable to assist families in the ways they used to. Some tasks they helped with included: applying for Social Security, setting up medical appointments, registering children for school, and more. Many families are illiterate, unable to speak English, and are in need of someone to aid them in the necessary steps to establish their lives in America. Anyone willing to offer their assistance will be paired with an experienced worker in the community. </p></div>
        <div class="right-column"><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf1mY2v6uBl0aiZ4EuJfZ7pZybCfTAvFlqqyIzD5lSdmlBOXg/viewform?usp=sharing" class="button">Volunteer Your Time</a></div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="left-column"><h3>Adopt a Family</h3><p>Friendship with a local is one of the most beneficial factors in helping a newly arrived family adjust to life in a new country. Rohingya families are in need of an individual, family, or community willing to commit to investing in relationship with them on a regular basis. People filling this role will be assisting with tasks that enable the family to be self-sustaining members of society. This exchange of relationship is without a doubt a gift for both parties. </p></div>
        <div class="right-column"><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScTG6nvqegF3KLFi1YGtsCIe-jDAIR1O7bIiJRFW-cLqlNlWw/viewform?usp=sharing" class="button">Adopt a Family</a></div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="left-column"><h3>Pray</h3><p>Many times when we have asked Rohingya people how neighboring communities can help, they say: "Pray." As people from a variety of faith backgroudns, we firmly believe God is the only One who can bring the most change -- making the impossible possible. </p></div>
